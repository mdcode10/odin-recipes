        <li>2 teaspoons of instant coffee</li>
        <li>2/3 cups of cold heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put aside 5 cookies for decoration.</li>
        <li>Finely crush the rest of oreo cookies in a food processor.</li> 
        <li>Melt 70g butter and combine with cookies.</li>
        <li>Press into the base and sides of a 25-27 cm loose-bottomed tart pan and chill for 30 minutes until firm.</li>
        <li>For the filling: beat butter with powdered sugar in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add peanut butter while beating.</li>
        <li>Add heavy whipping cream and continue beating for 2 min until dense and fluffy.</li> 
        <li>Spread the filling on the tart base.</li>
        <li>Put it to the fridge for 30 min.</li>
        <li>Prepare instant coffee in 1/8 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Combine coffee with heavy cream in a saucepan and boil it together.</li>
        <li>Take it from the stove and stir in dark chocolate until melted and fully combined.</li>
        <li>Let the chocolate glaze cool off.</li>
        <li>Take the tart out of the fridge and pour chocolate glaze evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Decorate it with crashed oreo cookies.</li>
        <li>Put the pie back in the fridge for 1-2 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Et voil√†!</strong></p>
    <p>The cake is extremely rich so it's better to cut it into really small pieces. Then, there's a better chance that it will last longer but I seriously doubt it!</p>
