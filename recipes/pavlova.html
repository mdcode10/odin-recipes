        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for Pavlova Meringue Cake. It's my go-to cake for various celebrations. What's most important, it's easy to make and delicious! You can impress your family and friends - everyone <em>loves</em> it! It's crunchy outside, creamy inside and with berries on the top!"</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Meringue</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups of white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 spoon of corn starch</li>
            <li>1 spoon of lemon juice</li>
            <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cream and berry sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz mascarpone</li>
            <li>16 oz heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 spoons of sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups frozen mixed berries mix</li>
            <li>2 12 oz raspberry packages </li>
            <li>6 oz blackberries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can decorate Pavlova with any fruit you like but I strongly recommend using berries (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries etc.) or acidic fruit like kiwi.</p>
