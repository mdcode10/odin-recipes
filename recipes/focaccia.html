<img src="/Users/mariastrzalkowski/repos/odin-recipes/img/IMG_5565.jpg" alt="Rectangular focaccia decorated with flowers made from vegetables and herbs">

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my spin off on traditional focaccia! It's still the same tasty dough but I wanted to be artistic and decorated it as best as I could.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to make but the decoration takes time so it depends on your creative vision!</p>
<p>I am sure it will be as delicious as mine with our without decoration. Good luck!</p>
