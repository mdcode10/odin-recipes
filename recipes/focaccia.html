<h2 class="description">Description</h2>
<p>This is my spin off on traditional focaccia! It's still the same tasty dough but I wanted to be artistic and decorated it as best as I could.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to make but the decoration takes time so it depends on your creative vision!</p>
<p>I am sure it will be as delicious as mine with our without decoration. Good luck!</p>

    <li>Rub the surface of the dough lightly with some olive oil. </li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cotton towel or foil and put it aside in a warm spot for a minimum 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Line 9Ã—13-inch pan with parchment paper or grease with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Transfer focaccia dough into the pan and spread it evenly.</li>
    <li>Put the pan with focaccia aside for another 30 min.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture of olive oil with water on focaccia and spread evenly making small holes in dough with your fingers</li>
    <li>Let your imagination loose and have fun decorating it!</li>
    <li>Transfer the pan to the preheated oven (425 degrees F) and bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the underside is golden and crisp.</li>

<p class="important-p">Freshly baked focaccia is crispy and it easily separates from the pan. Enjoy!</p>
